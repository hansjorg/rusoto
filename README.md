# Rusoto

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rusoto/rusoto.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rusoto/rusoto)

AWS SDK for Rust. [Documentation](http://rusoto.github.io/rusoto/rusoto/index.html).

IRC: #rusoto on irc.freenode.net.

## Installation

Rusoto is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rusoto).
To use Rusoto in your Rust program built with Cargo, add it as a dependency and enable the Cargo features for any AWS service you want to use.

For example:

``` toml
[dependencies.rusoto]
features = ["dynamodb", "s3"]
version = "x.y.z"
```

You can use the Cargo feature "all" to build Rusoto with support for every available service.

## Usage

Rusoto includes a public module for each AWS service it is compiled for containing Rust types for that service's API.
A full list of these services and their Cargo feature names are included at the end of this document.
Other public modules in the crate include types common between AWS APIs, such as credentials management, AWS regions, and API request signing.
Consult the rustdoc documenation for full details by running `cargo doc`.

A simple example of using the Rusoto's DynamoDB API to list the names of all tables in a database:

```rust
extern crate rusoto;

use default::Default;

use rusoto::credentials::DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain;
use rusoto::dynamodb::{DynamoDBClient, ListTablesInput};
use rusoto:regions::Region;

fn main() {
  let provider = DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain::new().unwrap();
  let region = Region::UsEast1;
  let mut client = DynamoDBClient::new(provider, &region);
  let list_tables_input: ListTablesInput = Default::default();

  match client.list_tables(&list_tables_input) {
    Ok(output) => {
      match output.TableNames {
        Some(table_name_list) {
          println!("Tables in database:");

          for table_name in table_name_list {
            println!("{}", table_name);
          }
        }
        None => println!("No tables in database!"),
      }
    }
    Err(error) => {
      println!("Error: {}", error);
    }
  }
}
```

Rusoto exposes relatively low level types for AWS's APIs.
It may be convenient to use higher level types, which can be found in the [rusoto_helpers](https://github.com/rusoto/rusoto_helpers) crate.

### Credentials

For more information on Rusoto's use of AWS credentials such as priority and refreshing, see [AWS Credentials](AWS-CREDENTIALS.md).

### Debugging

Rusoto uses the [log](https://crates.io/crates/log/) logging facade.
For tests it uses [env_logger](https://crates.io/crates/env_logger/).
To see output of logging from integration tests, run:

`RUST_LOG=info cargo test --features aws_integration`

## Semantic versioning

Rusoto complies with [semantic versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/).
Until reaching 1.0.0 the API is to be considered unstable.
See [Cargo.toml](Cargo.toml) or [rusoto on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rusoto) for current version.
